XPMToPIX by MickGyver
---------------------------
Converts all XPM images in a folder to PIX used by MiSTer i2c2oled.  
  
Usage:  
XPMToPIX [folder]  

If you run XPMToPIX without the folder argument, then XPMToPIX will convert  
all XPM files in the folder where XPMToPIX was run from.  
  
You can supply an optional argument -inv, --inv, -invert, --invert. This  
will invert the colors making a black pixel white on the display and vice  
versa.
